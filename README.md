Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly traverses an array(in our case that is).
During these traversals the algorithm compares adjacent elements swapping them to obtain
the desired order(which is in our case ascending).

  #bubble_sort is our first method and it takes an array of ints and sorts it

  #bubble_sort_by is more specialized as it sorts strings by their length. In the
  process it demonstrates how to use a Block, which is a new concept for me!
